To compile, put all of these items in a folder labeled "game".

Then, in the compiler, navigate to the folder game, and type:

qmake -project (press enter)
qmake (press enter)
make (press enter)
./game (press enter)

and the game will run. Controls are simply your mouse movement and mouse left and right clicks.

Enjoy!
